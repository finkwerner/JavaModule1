// The JRE on your computer must call the main method to trigger the program to run

// Being Static, the call will be directly on this class. It's not going to be called on an instance of this class
// Void is the return type of the method - It doesn't have to return something
// It is called "main" because the JRE will call your class "main" when executing it, so the name of the method also has to be the same
// String[] args - An array of strings that are arguments which can be passed to the program
// The code inside the "main" method will be executed when we run our program
// All other methods that you create, must be placed outside the "main" method, and you only call theme inside it
